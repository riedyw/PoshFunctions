Function ConvertTo-FileTime () {
<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Converts a [datetime] or datetime [string] into a large integer filetime.
.DESCRIPTION
    Converts a [datetime] or datetime [string] into a large integer filetime.

    Filetimes are expressed in Ticks. Ticks can range from 0 - 2650467743999999999. Translating these into dates you get
                      0 = Monday, January 01, 1601 12:00:00.00000 AM
    2650467743999999999 = Friday, December 31, 9999 11:59:59.99999 PM
.NOTES
    An [int64] filetime property is used in Active Directory. For instance against UserAccount it is in fields, badPasswordTime, LastLogon, accountExpires, LastLogonTimeStamp.
    There are other objects and fields in AD that use this filetime property, poke around and find them. Use this function to convert them into normal DateTime objects.
.EXAMPLE
    ConvertTo-FileTime -DateTime "1/25/2018 8:34:31 AM"

    Would return the [int64]
    131613608710000000
.EXAMPLE
    ConvertTo-FileTime '2/1/2018 4:27:59 PM'

    Would return the [int64]
    131619940790000000
.EXAMPLE
    "3/15/2018 12:00:00 PM" | ConvertTo-FileTime

    Would return the [int64]
    131656032000000000
.EXAMPLE
    ConvertTo-FileTime '2/1/2018 4:27:59 PM' -Verbose

    Would return the following:
    VERBOSE: The max # of ticks is '2650467743999999999' and the special NEVER flag is '9223372036854775807'
    VERBOSE: You entered a datetime of: '02/01/2018 16:27:59'
