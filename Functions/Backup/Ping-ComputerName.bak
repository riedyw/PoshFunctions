    Notes:      Ping (ICMP traffic) will be limited to within a VLAN in network baseline 4.0. ICMP traffic will NOT cross a firewall boundary in that baseline
.EXAMPLE
    Ping-ComputerName $DC
    Assuming $DC holds the name of the domain controller and it is running then would return the boolean
    $True
.EXAMPLE
    Ping-ComputerName "DoesNotExist"
    Assuming "DoesNotExist" doesn't actually exist as a computer name then would return the boolean
    $False
.OUTPUTS
    A boolean indicating if ICMP communication was successful or not
